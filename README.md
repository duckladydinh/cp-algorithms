## Submodules

`.gitmodules` is a generated file for configuring GIT submodules, so don't casually modify it for no reason.

### ac-library

This library is provided by AtCoder for implementing popular algorithms in competitive programming. To add it as a
submodule, run:

```shell
$ git submodule add https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library ac-library
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
